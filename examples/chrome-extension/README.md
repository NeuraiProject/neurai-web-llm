To run the extension, do the following steps under this folder

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a new directory at `chrome-extension/dist/`. To load the extension into Chrome, go to Extensions > Manage Extensions and select Load Unpacked. Add the `chrome-extension/dist/` directory. You can now pin the extension to your toolbar and use it to chat with your favorite model!
